Aluminum replaced iron and steel to reduce weight in some models. There were adjustments made to combustion chamber design and compression ratios that aided fuel economy. Mechanical advances were on display as we saw the first rear-engine car made in America, the Chevy Corvair. Also in 1960, the first alternator was used in a production car. Although alternators had been used extensively in vehicles like taxis, police cars and other vehicles with numerous gadgets and accessories, installing an alternator in a family car like the Chrysler Variant was a first. Some industry experts speculated industry-wide use of alternators within a decade. New safety regulations required that car manufacturers add or improve the following: Windshield washers, Defoggers, Dual-cylinder brake systems, Impact absorbing steering columns, Safe door latches. </p> </div> <div class="column-left"> <h3> Muscle Cars </h3> <p> As the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of 1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with muscle cars sold by most makes. The compact Ford Mustang, launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The "Big Three" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of Studebaker in 1966 left American Motors Corporation as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included compact and mid-sized cars in addition to full-sized ones. U.S retail buyers had 266 different models to choose from, with a standard price spread of $1,795 for a Rambler American sedan to $13,075 for the limited-edition Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. In general prices did not change much at all from the preceding year. </p> </div> <div class="column-right"><h3> Technology </h3> <p> Cars in California were equipped, for the first time, with a $45 device that reduced carbon monoxide gases. Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Clean Air Act authorizing the government to create standards to limit air pollution. For its 1966 cars, the industry created a “safety package”, which included backup lights, multiple windshield wipers, padded dashboard, rear seat belts and windshield washer fluid. The price of these items averaged about $50. The first front-wheel drive since 1937 was released in the Oldsmobile Toronado. People were shocked that someone would make a car that would pull by its front wheels instead of push from the back! New innovations included the station wagon dual-action tailgate and stereo tape players with FOUR speakers. Also new were Pontiac’s overhead cam, six-cylinder engine, Chrysler’s unique safety door handles and American Motors’ self adjusting clutch. </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </main> <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#wrapper").fullpage({anchors:["ex1","ex2","ex3","ex4"]})});</script> </body></html>
