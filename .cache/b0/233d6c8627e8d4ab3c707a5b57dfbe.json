One of the main factors in this production upswing was the governmentâ€™s relaxation of controls on steel, copper and aluminum. Materials shortages, although getting much better in 1953, had inspired new ways to make car bodies. Two different cars were introduced in 1953: one with a magnesium body and the other was plastic-fiberglass. Research and engineering teams bent their efforts toward making the 1954 models safer, less expensive and easier to drive. More than 50% of all new U.S. models were equipped with some form of automatic shift in 1953 and this number continued to rise in upcoming years. Many lower-priced cars were being fitted with power steering.  The powerful V8 engine became more commonplace in the newer and heavier cars of this era. Power windows became widespead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t   \t</div>\n\t\t\t\t   \t<div class=\"column-left\"> <h3> Rise of the Station Wagon </h3>\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t   \t\tThe post-World War II era brought a wide range of new technologies to the automobile consumer, and a host of problems for the independent automobile manufacturers. The industry was maturing in an era of rapid technological change; mass production and the benefits from economies of scale led to innovative designs and greater profits, but stiff competition between the automakers. By the end of the decade, the industry had reshaped itself into the Big Three (Ford, Chrysler and GM), Studebaker, and AMC. The age of small independent automakers was nearly over, as most of them either consolidated or went out of business. One of the most noteworthy trends in 1957 was the rise of the station wagon. By 1957, they accounted for more than 14% of new car sales. Staying consistent with post-war utilitarian attitude, the station wagons were build with strong steel bodies and a minimum of luxury frills. \n\t\t\t\t   \t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</div>\n\t\t\t\t   \t<div class=\"column-right\"><h3> Cultural Change </h3>\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe decade saw a shift in American culture due in part to suburbanization, the Interstate system, and the baby boom. The 1950s were centered in the post-war baby boom, with an average of about 4 million births annually throughout the decade. From 1946 to 1964, a total of about 77 million new \"baby boomers\" were born, dramatically increasing the demand for automobiles for new families. The new Interstate Highway system facilitated the migration to the suburbs. Automobile ownership had once been considered a luxury but now had become a necessity, as well as a cultural symbol for independence and individuality. Ever-larger families drove the demand for larger automobiles, and for the first time, many families owned more than one automobile. Several models in use today were initially introduced in the 50s- The Chevrolet Corvette, Chrysler 300 and the Ford Thunderbird.\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n         </div>\n      </section>\n    </main>\n\n<script>$(document).ready(function () {\n  $(\"#wrapper\").fullpage({\n    anchors: ['ex1', 'ex2', 'ex3', 'ex4']\n  });\n});</script>\n</body>\n\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"25e437b06db2771ec6ff12f345d18732","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
