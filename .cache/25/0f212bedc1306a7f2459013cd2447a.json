Styling on American cars became progressively more boxy and rectilinear during the 1970s, with coupes being the most popular body style. Wood paneling and shag carpets dominated the interiors. Many automobiles began to lose their character and looked the same across brands and automakers, as well as featuring \"luxury\" enhancements such as vinyl roofs and opera windows. Only a few had \"real personalities\" such as the AMC Gremlin, which was America's first modern subcompact, and the AMC Pacer. \"These two cars embody a sense of artful desperation that made them stand out from the crowd and epitomize at once the best and worst of the seventies.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<div class=\"column-left\"> <h3> Fuel-efficiency </h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t\tThe 1970s was an era of fuel price increases, rising insurance rates, safety concerns, and emissions controls. The 1973 oil crisis caused a move towards smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles. Attempts were made to produce electric cars, but they were largely unsuccessful. In the United States, imported cars became a significant factor for the first time, and several domestic-built subcompact models entered the market. American-made cars such as the \"quirky\" AMC Gremlin, the jelly bean shaped AMC Pacer, and Pontiac Firebird's powerful Trans Am \"sum up\" the decade. Muscle cars and convertible models faded from favor during the early-1970s. Automobiles in the U.S. reached the largest sizes they would ever attain, but by 1977, General Motors managed to downsize its full-size models to more manageable dimensions. \n\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<div class=\"column-right\"><h3> Foreign Mobiles </h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\tEuropean car design underwent major changes during the 1970s due to the need for performance with high fuel efficiency—designs such as the Volkswagen Golf and Passat, BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class appeared at the latter half of the decade. Ford Europe, specifically Ford Germany, also eclipsed the profits of its American parent company. The designs of Giorgetto Giugiaro became dominant, along with those of Marcello Gandini in Italy. The 1970s also saw the decline and practical failure of the British car industry—a combination of militant strikes and poor quality control effectively halted development at British Leyland, owner of all other British car companies during the 1970s. The car above is a Leyland P76, originally produced by Leyland Australia.\n\t\t\t\t\t</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    </main>\n\n\n<script>$(document).ready(function () {\n  $(\"#wrapper\").fullpage({\n    anchors: ['ex1', 'ex2', 'ex3', 'ex4']\n  });\n});</script>\n</body>\n\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"79cbb259ca01c97761f037f395d42cde","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
