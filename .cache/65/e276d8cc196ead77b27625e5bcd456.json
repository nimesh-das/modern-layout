In 1983, Ford design teams began to incorporate aerodynamic styling to decrease drag while in motion. The Thunderbird was one of the first cars to receive these design changes. In 1985, Ford released the Taurus with a design that was revolutionary among domestic mass market automobiles. Despite the financial and marketing upheavals during the 1970s and 1980s, these decades led to technological innovations and/or widespread use of such improvements as disc brakes, fuel injection, electronic engine control units, and electronic ignition. Front-wheel drive became the standard drive system by the late 1980s. The minivan was introduced in the 1984 model year by Chrysler and proved very popular. Built on a passenger-car chassis, these were able to seat up to seven people and hold bulky loads. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t   \t</div>\n\t\t\t\t   \t<div class=\"column-left\"> <h3> Japanese manufacturers </h3>\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t   \t\tThe American auto industry began the 1980s in a thoroughly grim situation, faced with poor quality control, rising import competition, and a severe economic downturn. Chrysler and American Motors (AMC) were near bankruptcy, and Ford was little better off. Only GM continued with business as usual. But the auto makers recovered with the economy by 1983, and in 1985 auto sales in the United States hit a new record. However, the Japanese were now a major presence, and would begin manufacturing cars in the US to get around tariffs. In 1986, Hyundai became the first Korean auto maker to enter the American market. These facilities were opened primarily in the southern states because of financial incentives offered by state governments, access to the nation via the interstate highways, the availability of a large pool of cheaper labor, and the weakness of unions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</div>\n\t\t\t\t   \t<div class=\"column-right\"><h3> Chrysler and Lee Iacocca </h3>\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t   \t\tUnder the leadership of Lee Iacocca, Chrysler Corporation mounted a comeback after its flirtation with bankruptcy in 1979. It introduced its new compact, front-wheel drive K-cars in 1981. The company turned a profit again the following year, and by 1983 paid off its government loans. A succession of models using this automobile platform followed. The most significant were the minivans in 1984. These proved to be popular and they would dominate the van market for more than a decade. In 1987, Chrysler purchased the Italian makes of Lamborghini and Maserati. In the same year, Chrysler bought AMC from Renault laying to rest the last significant independent U.S. automaker, but acquiring the hugely profitable Jeep line and continuing the Eagle brand until the late 1990s.\n\t\t\t\t   \t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</div>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n        \t</div>\n      </section>\n    </main>\n\n<script>$(document).ready(function () {\n  $(\"#wrapper\").fullpage({\n    anchors: ['ex1', 'ex2', 'ex3', 'ex4']\n  });\n});</script>\n</body>\n\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"d4cb4bbdc57223038d78a983cd76facb","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
